*  **When to use the accordion component**
    * If users will only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.
    * If you have only a small space to display a lot of content.
    * For hiding code chunks or answers to questions

*  **When to consider something else**
    * If users need to see most or all of the information on a page.
    * If there is not enough content to warrant condensing.  Accordions increase interaction cost for users.

Additional guidance can be found on the [USWDS component page](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/)

## Using the accordion component

*  **Use meaningful titles**:
    *  Accordion labels should be informative, such as "Additional information about GeoCDL Implimentation" rather than vague like “Click here.”
*  **Multiselectable accordions**:
    *  Add the data-allow-multiple attribute to any usa-accordion to create a multiselectable accordion group.
*  **Default an accordion button to open**: 
    *  Add *expanded="true"* to the accordion include statement to have that section open by default at page load.
