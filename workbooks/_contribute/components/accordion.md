*  **When to use the accordion component**
    * If users will only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.
    * If you have only a small space to display a lot of content.
    * For hiding code chunks or answers to questions

*  **When to consider something else**
    * If users need to see most or all of the information on a page.
    * If there is not enough content to warrant condensing.  Accordions increase interaction cost for users.

Additional guidance can be found on the [USWDS component page](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/)

## Using the accordion component

*  **Use meaningful titles**:
    *  Accordion labels should be informative, such as "Additional information about GeoCDL Implimentation" rather than vague like “Click here.”
*  **Multiselectable accordions**:
    *  Add the data-allow-multiple attribute to any usa-accordion to create a multiselectable accordion group.
*  **Default an accordion button to open**: 
    *  Add *expanded="true"* to the accordion include statement to have that section open by default at page load.



<div class="highlighted highlighted--tip ">
<div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1">

To link the user directly to a specific accordion and have that accordion open automatically, use the `nav-hidden` component with the ID used to create the accordion.
This component can take either dot notation for a relative path or use the full path.

* Linking accordions on other pages: 
  {% include nav-hidden text="See alternative ways to code alerts" url="./alerts#alternative-alert-code-code" %}
  ```
  {% raw %}{% include nav-hidden text="See alternative ways to code alerts" url="./alerts#alternative-alert-code-code" %}
  {% include nav-hidden text="See alternative ways to code alerts" url="/contribute/components/alerts#alternative-alert-code-code" %}{% endraw %}
  ```
* Accordion on same page:
  {% include nav-hidden text="Open the accordion options dropdown" url="#accordion-options-options" %}
  ```
  {% raw %}{% include nav-hidden text="Open the accordion options dropdown" url="#accordion-options-options" %}{% endraw %}
  ```
