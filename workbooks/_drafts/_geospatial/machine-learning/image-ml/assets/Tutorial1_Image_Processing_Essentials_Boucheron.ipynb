There are other plotting libraries, but `matplotlib` was designed to mimic much of the functionality of Matlab plotting and is thus very nice for those of us who transitioned from Matlab to python.\n",

We note that there are other powerful image libraries, including `PIL` / `pillow` which is used by the very nice `pandas` library for data manipulation.  We work with images as simple `nparrays` here since that best illustrates the basic image processing concepts.\n",
