## Getting Started

{% include setup/90daydata %}

### For Python

{% include setups environment=page.pyenv %}
1. {% include setup/conda %}
1. {% include setup/kernel %}
1. Launch JupyterLab
  * If you are working through a specific tutorial from this module,
  you can open the notebook you downloaded for that tutorial.
1. Select the kernel you just made:
  * Click on the "Switch kernel" button in the top right corner
  * Select "{{ kernel }}" and click "Select"
1. Check to make sure the kernel is set up correctly:
   * In the notebook's empty cell paste:
     ```python
     import keras
     print(keras.backend.backend())
     ```
   * The result should tell you you're using TensorFlow backend.
1. You are set up! You can return to your tutorial now, or get started with [Image Processing Essentials - Python](/geospatial/machine-learning/image-ml/image-processing/python).


### For R

{% include setups environment=page.renv %}
. You are set up! You can return to your tutorial now, or get started with [Image Processing Essentials - R](/geospatial/machine-learning/image-ml/image-processing/r).
